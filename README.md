## Overview

The **NCI Dose Hub** provides centralized access to **reference-grade radiation dose
estimation tools**, phantom libraries, and documentation developed at the
National Cancer Institute (NCI).

These resources are designed for **population-based dose evaluation,
benchmarking, and regulatory-facing analyses**, and are distributed
**only under approved research or commercial agreements**.

---

## Intended Audience

**This hub is intended for:**
- Commercial dose management and medical imaging software vendors  
- Academic or hospital-based dose platforms  
- Population-based, comparative, and regulatory-facing dose studies  

**This hub is *not* intended for:**
- Direct clinical decision support  
- Patient-specific or site-customized modeling  
- Real-time clinical dose calculation
